# Note: Mapbox GL is proprietary software

- Mapbox GL became proprietary software from end of 2020.
  - Mapbox GL JS is OpenSource software until v1.5.
  - Mapbox GL JS over v2 must require mapbox serviceâ€™s token.
- MapLibre GL ecosystems are fork of mapbox OpenSource versions.

  - Highly recommend to use MapLibre GL JS now.
