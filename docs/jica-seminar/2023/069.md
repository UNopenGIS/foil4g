# Design tiled map

- Vector tile doesn't have a style.
  - The client renders images with style settings.
- In this presentation, we use `charites` to design tiled map.
  - Charites convert Style Specification(JSON) to YAML.
  - YAML is easy to read and write for human.
  - YAML is easy to edit for beginners.
