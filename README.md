# FOIL4G: Free and Open Information Library for Geospatial

## Concept

We incorporate Benjamin Franklin’s library concept into the idea of the Free and Open Information Library for Geospatial (FOIL4G):

> "Since our books were often referred to in our disquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to have them all together where we meet, so that they might be consulted when needed. Additionally, by pooling our books into a common library, we would, while we liked to keep them together, have the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole."

This quote is highly relevant to emphasize the philosophy behind FOIL4G. FOIL4G aims to create an open library of geospatial information, allowing all members to freely access and collaboratively utilize the data. By doing so, it leverages individual resources to enhance the collective knowledge and capabilities of the entire community.

Specifically, FOIL4G can incorporate the following elements:

1. **Aggregation of Shared Resources**: Collect smart maps, geospatial data, relevant documents, and more in one place where everyone can access them.
2. **Collaborative Work and Learning**: Facilitate discussions among members, enabling them to consult necessary information on the spot for effective decision-making and problem-solving.
3. **Expansion of Knowledge**: By utilizing the shared library, each member can benefit from the knowledge and resources of others, thus enhancing their own capabilities.

In this way, FOIL4G applies Benjamin Franklin’s library concept to modern geospatial information systems, providing a platform where all participants can cooperate and grow together.

## Goals

- Create and provide a library of freely accessible geospatial data for everyone.
- Develop and provide a library of skills and recipes for handling those data.
- Facilitate effective decision-making and problem-solving through the sharing of that information.
- Promote the automatic processing of geospatial information by generative AI through the sharing of that information.

## Implementation

- `src`: Core React components and application logic for the web-based mapping interface
- `lib`
  - `api`: API for accessing geospatial information
  - `data`: Details for referencing geospatial information
  - `tasks`: Tasks for processing, analyzing, and transforming geospatial information
